# Backend Engineering test - Daniel Collins

## What did I think about the task?

With new applications and frameworks the biggest hurdle is usually the setup. And naturally, that's what happened this time.
I eventually found a tutorial that mentioned the main checkpoints in creating and running an application on Docker. I just had to 
fill in the blanks where steps and instructions were left out.

Allowing the user to input bytes without errors being thrown left right and center requried me to make a dictionary where the string value of the bytes mapped to the byte value of bytes? Does this make sense?
