How this was made: 

1. download and install pip, python3, python virtualenv, nameko, docker
2. start a python virtual environment in a chosen 
directory.by typing "virtualenv docktest" into console. This Creates a python virtual environment. 
https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/ 
3. Then run "docktest\Scripts\activate" in the console, and the virtual environment will be activated.
now the name of the environment will be in brackets on each command line of the console
4. Inside the console run "pip install nameko" to install nameko into the environment. 
5. run "docker run -p 5672:5672 --hostname nameko-rabbitmq rabbitmq:3" in the same console to start a docker on port 5672
6. create a python file using the Python Microservice template, found on https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/.
7.open another console window, cd into the directory and run "nameko run Microservice"
8.run "nameko shell" in another shell to speak to the running service
9.run n.rpc.micro_service.{function_name}.(parameters) in the shell, and it will talk back! And you're done.
10. "deactivate" in console to deactivate the environment

example calls in nameko shell: 
n.rpc.micro_service.encode_strings(str_list=["Daniel","1234","foo","bar"])
n.rpc.micro_servicea.decode_string(string="b'\\xfa _\\xa4'")
n.rpc.micro_service.square_odd(num_list=[-1,-2,-3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
